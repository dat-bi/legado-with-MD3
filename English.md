## 📖 Introduction

**Legado with MD3** is a Material Design 3–styled refactor based on the open-source project
👉 [Legado (阅读)](https://github.com/gedoor/legado).

In addition to a visual redesign of the UI, this project introduces multiple branch-specific
features.
It is also gradually migrating from the traditional **View system** to **Jetpack Compose**, aiming
to deliver a more modern, smooth, and consistent reading experience.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Important Notes**
>
> Due to the theme system being rebuilt on top of the **Monet engine**, themes from the official
> version are **not compatible** with this fork.
>
> **Devices below Android 12:**
> Custom themes and dynamic color features are currently unavailable.
> This limitation will be addressed after the Jetpack Compose migration is completed.
> (Due to limited developer resources, this process may take a considerable amount of time.)
